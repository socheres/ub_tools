{"abstract":"This article provides a review of the academic literature on the night-time economy (NTE) of British cities. The first half of the article concentrates on the development of the contemporary NTE by academics in the 1990s, showing how such ideas were translated to policy makers through their concomitance with other policies such as urban entrepreneurialism and market liberalization which fitted into neoliberal policy trends. The second half of the article discusses the subsequent academic critique of NTE. Although this has focused on the regulatory practices of neoliberalism, showing how these have lead to large concentrations of bars which promote unhealthy drinking practices, there has been a move in recent work to also consider the subjectivities which have developed in the neoliberal NTE. I suggest that an understanding of subjectivities informed by theoretical work of Deleuze and Guattari and non-representational theories, which see subjectivities as trans-personal assemblages which emerge through dispersed interactions between bodies and affects, can develop these insights. This moves research into neoliberal subjectivities in the NTE towards a research agenda in which the processes of the emergence of subjectivities are investigated and which thus responds to some of the recent critiques made of regulatory-focused approaches","acceptedDate":"2010-07-02T00:00:00","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"name":"Shaw, Robert"}],"citationCount":null,"contributors":[],"createdDate":"2012-07-02T02:59:54","dataProviders":[{"id":33,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/33/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/33"}],"depositedDate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00","documentType":"research","doi":"10.1111/j.1749-8198.2010.00345.x","downloadUrl":"https://core.ac.uk/download/15377.pdf","fieldOfStudy":"sociology","id":218070,"identifiers":[{"identifier":"oai:dro.dur.ac.uk.oai2:7529","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"10.1111/j.1749-8198.2010.00345.x","type":"DOI"},{"identifier":"15377","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"2166292226","type":"MAG_ID"}],"journals":[{"identifiers":["issn:1749-8198","1749-8198"],"title":"Geography Compass"}],"language":{"code":"en","name":"English"},"links":[{"type":"download","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/15377.pdf"},{"type":"reader","url":"https://core.ac.uk/reader/15377"},{"type":"thumbnail_m","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/15377/medium"},{"type":"thumbnail_l","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/15377/large"},{"type":"display","url":"https://core.ac.uk/works/218070"}],"magId":"2166292226","oaiIds":["oai:dro.dur.ac.uk.oai2:7529"],"outputs":["https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/15377"],"publishedDate":"2010-07-02T00:00:00","publisher":"'Wiley'","pubmedId":null,"references":[{"authors":[],"cites":null,"date":"2006","doi":"10.1080/00420980600711423","id":903814,"raw":null,"title":"A continental ambience?

{"abstract":"This paper aims to be both an example of how one may interpret an aspect of the ‘politics’ of everyday life and a critical comment on some of the emerging orthodoxy around the academic study of everyday life. These two themes are intertwined here but in summary the paper argues the following:\n\n\n\n• That the politics of everyday life are just as fruitfully approached through empirical study as they are via philosophical or cultural contemplation. \n\n\n\n• That the often stated idea that a ‘critique’ of everyday life can be readily built on the foundations of some small detail or other requires qualification.\n\n\n\n• That the orthodox distinction between everyday life and non-everyday life in terms of work and non-work realms needs qualification.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the paper concerns an empirical description, and subsequent analysis, of a series of everyday events, their effects and significant conse- quences; it describes changes, and the effects of these changes, occurring at Nottingham railway station over a short period of time (4 weeks from 29/09/02 onwards)","acceptedDate":null,"arxivId":null,"authors":[{"name":"Maycroft, Neil"}],"citationCount":null,"contributors":[],"createdDate":"2012-06-28T02:55:54","dataProviders":[{"id":128,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/128/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/128"}],"depositedDate":"2009-11-18T11:45:00","documentType":"research","doi":null,"downloadUrl":"https://core.ac.uk/download/56238.pdf","fieldOfStudy":null,"id":239347,"identifiers":[{"identifier":"oai:eprints.lincoln.ac.uk:2059","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"56238","type":"CORE_ID"}],"journals":[],"language":{"code":"en","name":"English"},"links":[{"type":"download","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/56238.pdf"},{"type":"reader","url":"https://core.ac.uk/reader/56238"},{"type":"thumbnail_m","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/56238/medium"},{"type":"thumbnail_l","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/56238/large"},{"type":"display","url":"https://core.ac.uk/works/239347"}],"magId":null,"oaiIds":["oai:eprints.lincoln.ac.uk:2059"],"outputs":["https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/56238"],"publishedDate":"2007-12-25T00:00:00","publisher":"","pubmedId":null,"references":[],"sourceFulltextUrls":[],"title":"Everyday life in the real world","updatedDate":"2021-12-22T04:29:25","yearPublished":2007},

{"abstract":"This article examines José Luis Sáenz de Heredia's film Los derechos de la mujer (1962), which raises questions about empowering women within the legal arena and mediates historical and cultural anxieties that circulated in more general terms after the legal changes of 1958 and 1961. It looks at this relatively early representation of filmic female lawyers, produced at a time when women were entering a traditionally male sphere and access to the legal profession itself was one of the main issues. It is theoretically informed by Cynthia Lucia's book entitled Framing Female Lawyers which examines female lawyers as catalysts of patriarchal crisis and argues that cultural representations of the female lawyer as a figure with access to the law most often entails that she herself will be interrogated and put on trial. Finally, it asks to what degree this early example of female lawyer films constructs the subjectivity of its female protagonist in the way that law constructs its female subjects at the time, namely as eternas menores with limited legal capacities who consequently activate their own mechanisms of containment. The film challenges, yet ultimately restores, patriarchal power through the action of the female lawyer; in that sense both law and the female lawyer are instruments of a male-dominated world","acceptedDate":"2012-02-02T00:00:00","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"name":"Louis, Anja"}],"citationCount":null,"contributors":[""],"createdDate":"2013-04-30T15:56:30","dataProviders":[{"id":4786,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/4786/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/4786"},{"id":102,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/102/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/102"}],"depositedDate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00","documentType":"research","doi":"10.1080/14753820.2012.646812","downloadUrl":"https://core.ac.uk/download/9831240.pdf","fieldOfStudy":null,"id":4399467,"identifiers":[{"identifier":"9831240","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"10.1080/14753820.2012.646812","type":"DOI"},{"identifier":"192869265","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"2036844425","type":"MAG_ID"},{"identifier":"oai:shura.shu.ac.uk:6702","type":"OAI_ID"}],"journals":[{"identifiers":["1475-3820"],"title":null}],"language":{"code":"en","name":"English"},"links":[{"type":"download","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/9831240.pdf"},{"type":"reader","url":"https://core.ac.uk/reader/9831240"},{"type":"thumbnail_m","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/9831240/medium"},{"type":"thumbnail_l","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/9831240/large"},{"type":"display","url":"https://core.ac.uk/works/4399467"}],"magId":null,"oaiIds":["oai:shura.shu.ac.uk:6702"],"outputs":["https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/192869265","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/9831240"],"publishedDate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00","publisher":"'Informa UK Limited'","pubmedId":null,"references":[],"sourceFulltextUrls":["http://shura.shu.ac.uk/6702/1/Louis_Whatever_next.pdf"],"title":"Whatever Next?

{"abstract":"Three-year-old Madeleine McCann disappeared on 3 May 2007 from a holiday apartment in Portugal. Over five years and multiple investigations that failed to solve this abducted child case, Madeleine and her parents were subject to a process of relentless ‘intermediatization’. Across 24–7 news coverage, websites, documentaries, films, YouTube videos, books, magazines, music and artworks, Madeleine was a mediagenic image of innocence and a lucrative story. In contrast to Madeleine’s media sacralization, the representation of her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, fluctuated between periods of vociferous support and prolonged and libellous ‘trial by media’. This article analyses how the global intermediatization of the ‘Maddie Mystery’ fed into and fuelled the ‘trial by media’ of Kate and Gerry McCann in the UK press. Our theorization of ‘trial by media’ is developed and refined through considering its legal limitations in an era of ‘attack journalism’ and unprecedented official UK inquiries into press misconduct and criminality","acceptedDate":"2012-09-03T00:00:00","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander JC"},{"name":"Bahktin M"},{"name":"Capella J"},{"name":"Casey Report"},{"name":"Chermak S"},{"name":"Christie N"},{"name":"Cohen S"},{"name":"Culture, Media and Sport Committee"},{"name":"Douglas M"},{"name":"Durkheim É"},{"name":"Fenton N"},{"name":"Greer C"},{"name":"Hutton W"},{"name":"Jenkins P"},{"name":"Jenkins P"},{"name":"Jenks C"},{"name":"Jewkes Y"},{"name":"Lloyd J"},{"name":"McCann K"},{"name":"McLaughlin E"},{"name":"Milne K"},{"name":"Moeller SD"},{"name":"Murdoch R"},{"name":"Pavlik JV"},{"name":"Purcell K"},{"name":"Sabato L"},{"name":"Silverman J"},{"name":"Valier C"},{"name":"Wilson P"}],"citationCount":null,"contributors":["Chris"],"createdDate":"2013-05-03T14:24:25","dataProviders":[{"id":176,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/176/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/176"},{"id":146,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/146/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/146"},{"id":4786,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/4786/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/4786"}],"depositedDate":"2012-09-03T00:00:00","documentType":"research","doi":"10.1177/1362480612454559","downloadUrl":"https://core.ac.uk/download/9982805.pdf","fieldOfStudy":null,"id":4409071,"identifiers":[{"identifier":"oai:repository.essex.ac.uk:27455","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"326247908","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"2054041816","type":"MAG_ID"},{"identifier":"9982805","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"210092654","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"oai:openaccess.city.ac.uk:1988","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"10.1177/1362480612454559","type":"DOI"}],"journals":[{"identifiers":["1362-4806"],"title":null}],"language":{"code":"en","name":"English"},"links":[{"type":"download","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/9982805.pdf"},{"type":"reader","url":"https://core.ac.uk/reader/9982805"},{"type":"thumbnail_m","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/9982805/medium"},{"type":"thumbnail_l","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/9982805/large"},{"type":"display","url":"https://core.ac.uk/works/4409071"}],"magId":"2054041816","oaiIds":["oai:openaccess.city.ac.uk:1988","oai:repository.essex.ac.uk:27455"],"outputs":["https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/326247908","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/9982805","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/210092654"],"publishedDate":"2012-09-03T00:00:00","publisher":"'SAGE Publications'","pubmedId":null,"references":[],"sourceFulltextUrls":["http://repository.essex.ac.uk/27455/1/CRO%202012%20-%20TC%20-%20Madeleine%20McCann.pdf"],"title":"Media justice: Madeleine McCann, intermediatization and \"trial by media\" in the British press","updatedDate":"2022-03-11T19:50:01","yearPublished":2012},
{"abstract":"Academic and political commentators have commonly sought to understand the Olympics as a cultural dynamic, a &quot;spectacle&quot; that motivates certain actors to project their relative interests in localized spaces and as well on a global scale (Hiller 2006; Boyle and Haggerty 2009b ). Mega-events, as this argument goes, are monumental cultural events (Roche 2000) that rely on the audacity of spectacle to dramatize and condition the cultural, political, legal and economic landscape. Extending these insights into surveillance studies, Boyle and Haggerty (2009b: 259-260) position spectacle and the disciplinary mechanisms of anxieties associated with mega-events to explain the risk management practices of security planners. The dynamic social implications of the spectacle condition dramatic regimes of securitization and surveillance such that sovereign power emanates from the production and consumption of spectacle. In similar fashion Vida Bajc (2007: 1648) writes that security meta-rituals &quot;demonstrate[s] that the process of transformation of [the] public space [of mega-events] from one of routine of daily life into a sterile area [that] has a ritual form [that] .... separates insiders from outsiders and brings about a new socio-political reality.&quot; Put another way, the &quot;security-meta ritual&quot; legitimates security and surveillance practices by normalizing the social hierarchies it imposes. Bajc focuses on the over-determination of dividing practices in mega-event security, but the signifying practices associated with capital are absent (perhaps due to her empirical focus on presidential addresses). Klauser (2008: 181) links commercialization and mechanisms of surveillance, but only by foregrounding the significance of &quot;neutralized space&quot; created by granting absolute commercial rights to event sponsors. Neoliberalprivatization and its articulation with security and surveillance, however, cannot be reduced to control over sponsorship rights and consumptive practices in particular urban &quot;zones,&quot; nor can it be limited by the methodological temporality of the event itself","acceptedDate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"name":"Coaffee, J"},{"name":"Fussey, P"}],"citationCount":null,"contributors":["Haggarty,KD","Bennett,CJ"],"createdDate":"2013-05-07T11:48:01","dataProviders":[{"id":176,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/176/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/176"},{"id":530,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/530/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/530"},{"id":4786,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/4786/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/4786"}],"depositedDate":"2012-12-19T15:26:00","documentType":"research","doi":"10.4324/9780203827475","downloadUrl":"https://core.ac.uk/download/9995272.pdf","fieldOfStudy":null,"id":4417348,"identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.4324/9780203827475","type":"DOI"},{"identifier":"9995272","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"oai:repository.essex.ac.uk:4808","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"457434759","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"oai:dro.deakin.edu.au:du:30069665","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"33201818","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"1044995229","type":"MAG_ID"}],"journals":[],"language":{"code":"en","name":"English"},"links":[{"type":"download","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/9995272.pdf"},{"type":"reader","url":"https://core.ac.uk/reader/9995272"},{"type":"thumbnail_m","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/9995272/medium"},{"type":"thumbnail_l","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/9995272/large"},{"type":"display","url":"https://core.ac.uk/works/4417348"}],"magId":"1044995229","oaiIds":["oai:dro.deakin.edu.au:du:30069665","oai:repository.essex.ac.uk:4808"],"outputs":["https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/9995272","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/457434759","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/33201818"],"publishedDate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00","publisher":"'Informa UK Limited'","pubmedId":null,"references":[],"sourceFulltextUrls":[],"title":"Olympic rings of steel: Constructing security for 2012 and beyond","updatedDate":"2022-02-28T11:39:09","yearPublished":2011},
{"abstract":"The use of ‘European consensus’ as a decision-making mechanism of the European Court of Human Rights has been condemned and praised in almost equal measure.1 On the one hand, some scholars argue that the way in which so-called ‘consensus’ is identified is generally unsound and lacking in rigour.2 It is also claimed that European consensus is overly subjective in its nature3 and, in any case, that it undermines the principle that the Convention has an autonomous meaning determined by the Court and separate to what member States do or interpret it as meaning.4 On the other hand there are scholars who, while often concerned with the suboptimal methodology adopted in identifying and using European consensus in the decisions of the Court, recognize the method's potential to increase the legitimacy of the Court and its function as a mechanism for the progressive liberalization of the European public order.5 This reflects the fact that, generally speaking, European consensus has been applied in order to establish an expanded scope of protection for the Convention in areas not expressly mentioned within it or contemplated at the time of its drafting, on the basis that there is an identifiable trend (although, in strict linguistic terms, not an actual ‘consensus’) among other European States to protect the alleged right","acceptedDate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"name":"Arai-Takahashi"},{"name":"Benvenisti"},{"name":"Brauch"},{"name":"Daly"},{"name":"de Londras"},{"name":"de Londras"},{"name":"Delmas-Marty"},{"name":"Dzehtsiarou"},{"name":"Dzehtsiarou"},{"name":"Fiona de Londras"},{"name":"Helfer"},{"name":"Hennette-Vauchez"},{"name":"Hogan"},{"name":"Jenkins"},{"name":"Kanstantsin Dzehtsiarou"},{"name":"Kavanagh"},{"name":"Kuijer"},{"name":"Lester"},{"name":"Letsas"},{"name":"Lock"},{"name":"Mahoney"},{"name":"Martens"},{"name":"Martens"},{"name":"Mowbray"},{"name":"Murray"},{"name":"Schweppe"},{"name":"Sweet"},{"name":"Verschraegen"},{"name":"Waldron"},{"name":"Wildhaber"},{"name":"Wildhaber"}],"citationCount":null,"contributors":[""],"createdDate":"2013-03-21T14:35:01","dataProviders":[{"id":33,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/33/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/33"},{"id":4786,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/4786/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/4786"},{"id":108,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/108/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/108"}],"depositedDate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00","documentType":"research","doi":"10.1017/s0020589312000620","downloadUrl":"https://core.ac.uk/download/9642534.pdf","fieldOfStudy":"sociology","id":4379878,"identifiers":[{"identifier":"193596439","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"oai:epubs.surrey.ac.uk:749341","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"2032845416","type":"MAG_ID"},{"identifier":"oai:dro.dur.ac.uk.oai2:10504","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"oai:surrey.eprints-hosting.org:749341","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"10.1017/s0020589312000620","type":"DOI"},{"identifier":"9642534","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"16517391","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"427333767","type":"CORE_ID"}],"journals":[{"identifiers":[" 1471-6895","0020-5893","issn:0020-5893","issn: 1471-6895"],"title":"International and Comparative Law Quarterly"}],"language":{"code":"en","name":"English"},"links":[{"type":"download","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/9642534.pdf"},{"type":"reader","url":"https://core.ac.uk/reader/9642534"},{"type":"thumbnail_m","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/9642534/medium"},{"type":"thumbnail_l","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/9642534/large"},{"type":"display","url":"https://core.ac.uk/works/4379878"}],"magId":"2032845416","oaiIds":["oai:epubs.surrey.ac.uk:749341","oai:surrey.eprints-hosting.org:749341","oai:dro.dur.ac.uk.oai2:10504"],"outputs":["https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/16517391","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/193596439","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/9642534","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/427333767"],"publishedDate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00","publisher":"'Cambridge University Press (CUP)'","pubmedId":null,"references":[],"sourceFulltextUrls":["http://dro.dur.ac.uk/10504/1/10504.pdf"],"title":"II.

{"abstract":"One of the most distinctive features of Nazi society was the increasingly radical division of its members into “national comrades” and “community aliens.” The former were to be protected by the state and encouraged to procreate, while the latter were seen as political, social, racial, or eugenic threats and were to be ruthlessly eliminated from society. With the start of the Second World War, various nonlethal forms of discrimination against these “community\n\naliens” were gradually replaced by policies geared to physical annihilation, culminating above all in the extermination of the European Jews. In view of a crime of this previously unimaginable magnitude, it is hardly surprising that when historians started in earnest to examine the genocidal policies of the Nazi dictatorship in the 1960s they focused on the development and administration\n\nof the “Final Solution of the Jewish Question,” as the Nazis called it.\n\nBut in the last two decades, the fate of other “community aliens” in the Third\n\nReich, such as the Roma and Sinti (“Gypsies”), slave laborers, and the disabled, has been investigated too.\n\nSome historians have also begun to examine those who deviated in various\n\nother ways from the norms of society, people who were often classified in the\n\nThird Reich, and indeed before, as “asocials.” There was never an agreed definition as to who these people were, and the term was used to stigmatize a vast variety of nonnormative behavior. According to a 1938 directive by the head of the German security police, Reinhard Heydrich, any person could be classified\n\nas “asocial” who “demonstrates through conduct opposed to the community\n\n. . . that he does not want to adapt to the community.” During the Third\n\nReich, such vague statements served as the basis for the persecution of juvenile delinquents, criminal offenders, vagrants, prostitutes, and homosexuals, among many others. Certain groups were simultaneously classified as racial and social outsiders and thus suffered “dual racism.” This was true in particular for the Sinti and Roma, who had been persecuted for their way of life long before the Nazi “seizure of power” in 1933. Historical research into the fate of the “asocials” has produced some valuable insights into the treatment of members of these marginal groups in the Third Reich, many of whom died in SS concentration or extermination camps. Yet despite this growing interest, the most comprehensive of all the extermination programs directed against “asocials” in the Third Reich has never been investigated. From late 1942 onward, over twenty thousand offenders classified as “asocial” were taken out of the state penal system and transferred to the police for “annihilation through labor.” At least two-thirds of them perished in concentration camps. But in the historical literature this program has either been dealt with in passing or completely ignored.\n\nWhy have historians neglected the murder of state prisoners? There appears\n\nto be a reluctance to focus on offenders against the law in the Third Reich, unless their offences can be seen in some way as forms of political or social protest. In contrast to the racially or politically persecuted, not all common criminals can be described merely as innocent victims, and the often brutal behavior of criminal Kapos in concentration camps probably further alienated historians from dealing with the criminals. Another factor that explains the poor state of research is the inaccessibility of source material. Leading officials in the Ministry of Justice made sure that most files relating to the “annihilation\n\nthrough labor” of state prisoners were pulped before the end of the war.8 Yet\n\nindividual documents have survived, scattered around various archives in Germany. They can be complemented by information gained from individual prisoner files, as well as from unpublished documents and testimonies collected in numerous postwar legal investigations. None of these criminal investigations ever led to the conviction of the prison officials involved—another reason for the lack of historical interest. Finally, German legal history after the war spread\n\nthe myth that the legal administration had rejected or even resisted the Nazi\n\nregime. State penal institutions, if dealt with at all, were described as safe havens that had “nothing to do with the concentration camps.” Thus, until today, historians have largely ignored the state prison system and its inmates. This article will first describe the origins of the decision in 1942 for the extermination of certain state prisoners. Then the actual process of transfer will be investigated in detail, examining issues such as the background of the\n\ntransferred inmates and the participation of prison officials. The article will also deal with the fate of the state prisoners after their transport to the Nazi concentration camps and the radicalization of policy against the prisoners remaining\n\nin the state penal institutions. Exploring these issues contributes to\n\nour knowledge of the treatment of deviants in the Third Reich.\n\nBut this article will also address some wider issues concerning the nature of the Nazi dictatorship, such as the origins of extermination policies in the Third Reich. In recent years, a number of historians have argued that it was time to move beyond the “sterile debates” between so-called intentionalist historians, who focused on the murderous will and ideology of the Nazi leaders, above all Hitler, and so-called structuralist historians, who pointed to the dynamic and uncoordinated interactions between different agencies of the Nazi dictatorship that led to a “cumulative radicalization” (Hans Mommsen). Various historians have now put forward a synthesis of both positions, while ground-breaking empirical research into the “final solution” has posed new questions and provided new answers. Still, many of the more recent studies of Nazi genocide continue to explore central issues first raised in the debates between intentionalists\n\nand structuralists such as Hitler’s role in extermination policy, the interaction between regional officials and the decision makers in Berlin, and the role of racial ideology versus more material motives in Nazi mass murder. This study of the “annihilation through labor” of state prisoners addresses some of these general issues.\n\nIt will also shed new light on the relation between the judiciary and the\n\npolice in the Third Reich. The postwar portrait of a passive or even anti-Nazi\n\njudiciary has not gone unchallenged. Still, many historians continue to describe the judicial authorities and the police as having been in a constant state of conflict. They describe the Third Reich as a “dual state,” split between the “prerogative state” and the “normative state.” The latter was the traditional state apparatus, ensuring that normal life was ruled by legal norms. However, in matters that were thought to touch on the interest of the state, the “prerogative state” could override these legal norms, above all through the agency of the police, locking up all political, racial, and social suspects in SS concentration\n\ncamps without trial. Thus, state attorneys and the police are seen as competing institutions of prosecution, while state penal institutions and concentration camps are described as competing institutions of confinement. A detailed investigation of the transfer of state prisoners can help to establish how far this picture of the “dual state” stands up to critical scrutiny","acceptedDate":"1999-09-01T00:00:00","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"name":"Wachsmann, Nikolaus"}],"citationCount":null,"contributors":[],"createdDate":"2012-06-22T02:56:40","dataProviders":[{"id":2849,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/2849/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2849"},{"id":8,"logo":"https://api.core.ac.uk/data-providers/8/logo","name":"","url":"https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/8"}],"depositedDate":"1999-09-01T00:00:00","documentType":"research","doi":"10.1086/235291","downloadUrl":"https://core.ac.uk/download/7424.pdf","fieldOfStudy":null,"id":214824,"identifiers":[{"identifier":"2089629349","type":"MAG_ID"},{"identifier":"oai:eprints.bbk.ac.uk.oai2:262","type":"OAI_ID"},{"identifier":"10.1086/235291","type":"DOI"},{"identifier":"141212581","type":"CORE_ID"},{"identifier":"7424","type":"CORE_ID"}],"journals":[{"identifiers":["0022-2801"],"title":null}],"language":{"code":"en","name":"English"},"links":[{"type":"download","url":"https://core.ac.uk/download/7424.pdf"},{"type":"reader","url":"https://core.ac.uk/reader/7424"},{"type":"thumbnail_m","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/7424/medium"},{"type":"thumbnail_l","url":"https://core.ac.uk/image/7424/large"},{"type":"display","url":"https://core.ac.uk/works/214824"}],"magId":"2089629349","oaiIds":["oai:eprints.bbk.ac.uk.oai2:262"],"outputs":["https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/7424","https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/outputs/141212581"],"publishedDate":"1999-09-01T00:00:00","publisher":"'University of Chicago Press'","pubmedId":null,"references":[],"sourceFulltextUrls":[],"title":"\"Annihilation through labor\": the killing of state prisoners in the Third Reich","updatedDate":"2022-03-16T09:34:30","yearPublished":1999},
